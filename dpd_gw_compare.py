# The results of this calculation can be directly compared with Fig 4
# of the Groot and Warren [J. Chem. Phys. v107, 4423 (1997)].  The
# data from that figure is coded below.  This is taken from
# gw_p_compare.py from SunlightHNC.

# For the virial pressure here, see Eq. (2.5.22) in Hansen & McDonald,
# "Theory of Simple Liquids" (3rd edition): virial pressure, p = ρ +
# 2πρ²/3 ∫_0^∞ dr r³ f(r) g(r) where f(r) = −dv/dr is the force.

# The constant term here captures the mean field contribution, that
# is the integral evaluated with g(r) = 1.  Specifically:
# ∫_0^∞ dr r³ f(r) = A ∫_0^1 dr r³ (1−r) = A/20 .
